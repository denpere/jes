Think about:
 - version caching? to avoid every-write check
 - multithreaded write - to be or not to be?
 - event-intersepter ?? handling?
 - make snapshotting
 - snapshots invalidation
 - store structure validation on start
 - ~~event idempotency on read (clustered environment)~~ done by locking for projectors
 - ~~event steam deletion~~
 - ~~store drain-to? - recreate event store~~
 - ~~copy-and-replace event stream~~
 - ~~split event stream~~
 - ~~merge event streams~~
 - transaction processing for unsafe operations??
 - ~~string (json?) serializer~~
 - string (xml) serializer (xstream?) 
 - upcaster?
